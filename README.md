# CPU Scheduling Simulation

This project simulates various cpu scheduling algorithms, outputting simulation results and metrics to the terminal. Considered scheduling methods are Preemptive Round Robin, and Preemptive Shortest-Job-First. For the Preemptive Round Robin simulations, time quantums of 2, 4, 6, and 8 are used. Example results are as follows, and can be viewed in. the sim-results directory of this repository.
